# UU_Data_Science_Project
This is the code for the University of Utrecht Summer School 'Data Science: Programming with Python' final project. 
This was a group project, using data on consumer confidence published by Statistics Netherlands. 

We had four main questions: 

1. Is there a correlation between willingness to buy and the right time to make a large purchase?
2. What is the difference in consumer confidence between Summer and Winter?
3. What variable has the greatest effect on Consumer Confidence?
4. Is there a difference in Consumer Confidence in a post-Covid Netherlands?
